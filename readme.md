# Biyahe (Trip)

Biyahe is a tool that helps users plan for their next trip! The app uses Yelp as its search engine, which returns restaurants, parks, and local attractions based on user's location input. Users can create and add places they want to visit to their itineraries. Through the browsing function, users can search up other user's existing itineraries and upvote on their favorite ones! The most popular itineraries will be showcased for all to see.
