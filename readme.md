# Biyahe (Trip)

Biyahe is a tool that helps users plan for their next trip! The app uses Yelp as its search engine, which returns restaurants, parks, and local attractions based on user's location input. Users can create and add places they want to visit to their itineraries. Through the browsing function, users can search up other user's existing itineraries and upvote on their favorite ones! The most popular itineraries will be showcased for all to see.

# Improvements
I plan on continuing to customize the application to include more features that will further streamline trip planning. 

Weather forecasting - Include weather information for selected date. This information can dictate what the user would like to do for the day - for example, if it was raining on a particular day, the user might decide to save outside activities for another day.
